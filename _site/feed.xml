Here I’ll share my thoughts and
anything which I discover in my life and I think it to be worth sharing with the World.
I’ll be currently posting one post per week and there will be one technical and one non-technical post on
 alternate weeks. Starting with a non-technical post so that everyone can read it.&lt;/p&gt;
