Meet Picksy:<br /><br />

![Picksy's photo](/assets/images/picksy_002.jpeg)

She had been with my family since 1<sup>st</sup> May 2005 and she was like a family member. She left
her body on 27<sup>th</sup> November 2018.
We were so much accustomed to her that it's been very difficult to accept that she has left.
<br />

<p>
Everyone in my family was involved with her in one way or the other. My mother used to give her food.
My sister and I used to take her for walk and take care of her whenever she would be ill. My father 
used to bring pedigree and other things she liked for her from the market.
</p>

But the way she left her body was the least painful one possible. Also, she could drink 
[Holy Gangajal](https://www.speakingtree.in/blog/significance-behind-consuming-gangajal){:target="_blank"} from my
mother's hands in her last moments which ensures that one attains Nirvana after life.

Considering these things, we shouldn't be sad at all for her as she has gone to her heavenly abode,
away from the shackles of this mortal world.

What we can learn from her demise:
1. Death is certain for everyone who has taken birth
2. Loss of life is the biggest loss possible
3. One should take care of those whom they are associated with and live the life in the present as 
we never know what is going to happen in the next moment
4. One should always focus their mind on God, who is the eternal reason for this existence, and perform
their duties with full devotion

Picksy will always be remembered for her loyalty, innocence and courage.
