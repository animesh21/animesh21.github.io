This is my first post on my blog called "My Life: Journey and beyond...". Here I'll share my thoughts and
anything which I discover in my life and I think it to be worth sharing with the World.
I'll be currently posting one technical and one non-technical post alternately. Starting with an introduction to
myself.

I was born and brought up in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India. I had been interested in science and technology since childhood.
But alongside I had also been interested in knowing the secret of life, death and how the existence came to be.
I liked science because it could give rational answers to few of my questions like "why is the color of sky blue?",
"how can I see my duplicate in the mirror?" etc.

But more subtle questions were yet unanswered, like "Who am I?", "What is my purpose and the purpose of the whole
existence at large?" etc. On one side, I continued to learn science and mathematics, and on the other, I was pursuing
my questions regarding myself and my purpose.

One day, when I was in 9th standard and biology class was going on,
my biology teacher told in the class that you all should, at your home, sit quietly for 5 minutes without allowing any
thoughts in the mind. He challenged that it would be difficult for us to do it, even for 5 minutes. He mentioned it's
called "meditation". I don't remember if he told anything further about it or not. But I gave it a try and it was really
difficult to keep off the thoughts. When you're thinking of not thinking, then also you're thinking, so I was tricked.

Then I read more about *meditation* and found that it connects people to their real selves. This was exactly
what I had been seeking. So, I bought a book on *meditation* and tried to practice after reading from the book.
I could not continue it for a long but it gave me a direction.

Meanwhile, I graduated in Electronics & Communication Engineering from Ajay Kumar Garg Engineering College,
Ghaziabad, India. I had developed an interest in *Software Engineering* in my college days only and hence, started
working as a software professional after graduating.

On my spiritual journey, I had found an authentic source and a companion to guide me through the life and that was
*Bhagwad Gita*.

Since then, I've been simply following the path as described in *Bhagwad Gita*. This path is about performing our
duties selflessly, but with full consciousness and enthusiasm. It gives you an opportunity to live your life to
the fullest, not as a servant of your mind or senses, but a master.
